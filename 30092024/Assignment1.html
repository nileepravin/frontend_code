      <h1>Campaigns</h1>
      <p>
        A Google Ads campaign is a set of one or more ad groups (ads, keywords,
        and bids) that share a budget, location targeting, and other settings.
        Campaigns are typically used to organize categories of products or
        services offered by an advertiser. Items that can be set at the campaign
        level include bids, budget, language, location, distribution for the
        Google Network, and more. Large advertisers typically create separate ad
        campaigns to run ads in different locations or using different budgets.

      <h2>Campaign types</h2>
      <p>
        Campaign types are centered around Google's advertising networks: the
        Google Search Network, the Google Display Network, and the YouTube
        Network. These networks make up all the places where your ads can
        appear, including Google sites, websites that show relevant Google ads,
        and other placements (such as mobile apps). You choose a network setting
        by selecting a campaign type for your campaign. The API supports the
        following campaign types:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Display Network only</li>
        <li>Search Network only</li>
        <li>Display Expansion on Search</li>
        <li>Local campaigns</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can use the API to create and manage campaigns optimized for
        different marketing objectives:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>App campaigns</li>
        <li>Call-only</li>
        <li>Discovery</li>
        <li>Performance Max</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Differences from the Google Ads UI</h3>
      <p>
        Not all campaign types in the Google Ads UI are supported in the API,
        such as Video Campaigns. Video campaign metrics are available for
        retrieval in the API. However, video campaigns cannot be mutated at all
        from the API, including simple operations such as pausing or enabling as
        well as complex operations like organizing, changing criteria, or adding
        ad groups. Campaign subtypes Campaign subtypes in the Google Ads UI,
        such as Standard and All features, help UI users find relevant campaign
        options, but there is no corresponding attribute in the API's Campaign
        object. This UI column is similar to the AdvertisingChannelType and
        AdvertisingChannelSubType fields in the API, but there is not a
        one-to-one mapping between these fields and Campaign subtype in the UI.
        For example, a Search-only campaign created using the API will always be
        an All features campaign from the UI perspective.
